              description="LangAI is an AI-powered language training mobile application that also offers chatbot support. I developed the app using the Gemini API and Expo, customizing the AI model to meet the project's specific needs. The app allows users to write a sentence in their native language and attempt to translate it into the target language. The AI provides feedback on errors, corrects the translation, or confirms that itâ€™s accurate. Additionally, there's a chat mode where the AI interacts like a real chatbot, but with a key difference: it analyzes any mistakes the user makes during conversation and offers training on those errors. Chat history and personal data are stored on the device's memory."
